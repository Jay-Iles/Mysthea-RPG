Chapter 08 - Quests for Valiant Hearts


A Varorin storyteller winds down…


Once upon a time, a brave knight rode into a dark forest to slay a dragon, hoping to free the land from the grasp of a dire winter. 


Beautiful quest, isn’t it?


Too bad it won’t do us any good!


Reality is often much more complex than slaying something or undertaking a journey, no matter how harsh and perilous it may be. We face challenges that require more than simply effort and goodwill. We are talking about environments that refuse to follow your rules, instead of its own primeval rhythms. Of people with their own culture and opinions, who sometimes might even refuse any help, for they fail to see the crisis as you do. Of going against decades and maybe centuries of history that tell you that change hearts and minds is impossible   


These are the odds you must face if you are to fulfill the Quests that our Borderlands need you to right now. 
The State of Matters
War has moved on from the City, but we all bear its scars and not all of them are skin deep. When first encountered, a Quest can be: 


* Quickening - even though everyone realises the problem, most fail to understand the full scope of the pain it brings or its long term consequences. Worse still, nobody seems to agree on how (or even if) it should be dealt with. 
   * Street urchins infest the market square - Where are their parents? Where do they live? What alternative to petty thieving do they have?
   * Maimed veterans feel the Kingdom abandoned them after a life of dutiful service and sacrifice - What do they do to mute the pain of their scars? How do they express their resentment towards the Guilds and the Kingdom? Who takes advantage of their state to make a profit?
   * The fields that feed the city lie abandoned and food must come from far away to avert famine - What of those who can’t pay the rising prices? Beasts of burden have been eaten long ago, who must work in their place instead? What will become of the Children of the War, who grew up feeding on scraps? 


* Mature - the problem is now seen as ‘part of life’ and many think it’s far too late for any solution other than the most radical or naive. People have lost hope things could ever get any better. Others might exploit this gaping wound in the City to their own interests, turning bitter pain into pure poison or explosive rage. 
   * Urchins grew up without education and now can’t find any proper jobs - Who exploits this desperate underclass? How does the City respond to the exploding criminality? What are the consequences of them living in the worst Ambience polluted areas of the City?
   * Veterans are granted land in the Borderlands - How can they work injured as they are? Who is stopping them from returning home? How can they fit in a society at peace if they trained their whole lives for war?
   * Expensive food created a terminal inequality gap between the haves and have-nots - Are the inequality lines cleanly divided between conquerors and conquered? Why don’t people tend for the barren fields? How does the City react to the successive plagues that hit the poorest districts?


And depending on the Heroes’ actions (or lack thereof), they can evolve to:
 
* Lost - the problem shifts into something else entirely and most will deny that the current crisis steem from their past inaction. It’s too late now for any action and a reckoning is at hand. 
   * A lost generation achieves critical mass in the slums… they have nothing to lose - Where does the demagogue that lead the unwashed masses come from? What has sparked the riots that shake the City’s foundations? When did crime overwhelm the City’s law enforcement?
   * Veterans face two choices: life in the gutters or to die on their own terms - How does the veterans’ pain taint the City’s culture as a whole? What insidious enemy starts recruiting from these dissatisfied survivors? What does the Kingdom’s army lose with the veterans’ plight?
   * The City starts to wither from within and soon it might become a haunted ruin - Where do the desperate masses flee to when life becomes too harsh in the City? How does the wilds reclaim the fields and the City limits? What do the rich leave behind when they too decide there is nothing left to gain from the City?


* Healed - a problem this big never simply disappears, and whenever a simple solution is used, two new problems emerge. It takes time. It takes dedication. But if the problem is dealt with, the City draw renewed energy from the crisis. 
   * The urchins receive proper education and shelter, provided by the Guilds. When they come of age, they become respected apprentices of masters across the Kingdom. One day, they might return home and repeat the cycle of prosperity and hope. 
   * The Venture builds a fort where all veterans work to train the future generations as soldiers. As the War abattes, the Fort becomes a center of learning in a variety of matters. The veterans still suffer from their wounds, but driven by a higher purpose they endure as soldiers always do, with a smile on their faces. 
   * Nobody thought it would be so difficult! The fields are plowed by a cooperative effort, coordinated by the Venture. Many in the City resent the freedom given to the conquered and work to undermine the cooperative. As they fail and crops prosper, the conquered demand more voice in the running of the City, which causes an uproar among more conservative voices. It takes a lifetime, but eventually they are granted a House status, but without the Venture’s protection. 


In a box!
We would like to remind you that these issues and the pain they bring is all to real. There are countless people around the world facing challenges much greater than whatever we can enact in our game tables. Respect their plight. 
How?
Learn about it!  
We will provide a single NGO for each issue - these are real world warriors facing real quests and challenges. Read, join, contribute… or simply become aware of it. And send those they help your prayers, if nothing else. We live in a war torn and long suffering word. Step up and help healing it.   


It might be difficult to gauge at first the state of a Quest, so for simplicity sake we assume they are always Quickening when Heroes and Guilds first hear of it. If not dealt with somehow, Quests will degrade from Quickening to Mature after: 
* an Age of neglect,
* massive upheaval that somehow affects it, 
* or direct action to worsen its condition. 
And then to Lost if another of these conditions is met. 
Blood, Sweat and Tears
We can not recommend you enough to listen to the Fiction and give these matters some serious, serious thought. There are no hard and fast and rules, and problems will shift based on the consequences of your and interactions with other elements present in your setting. However,  consider the Venture was sent with enough resources to tackle precisely these kind of difficulties: a Guild must in theory only Employ a relevant Resource to mitigate a Mature Quest to Quickening.


In addition to the Guild Resources, you must send boots on the ground to truly understand people and the land. Without this connection all solutions will fail to grasp the heart of the matter. In other words, Heroes must Zoom In at some point to Heal a Quickening Quest. They could have gone before their Guilds mitigated the Quest from Mature to Quickening, and in the next Guild Action that would mitigate a Quickening Quest, it will now be Healed. Again, there are not charts or fixed procedures on how to solve a Quest, but Unearth, Encounter and Negotiate will certainly help.


There are two other ways to solve a Quest:


* A dangerous method is through the clever application of the Qoam Arts. A Guild can perform Rituals to generate a phantom Resource to mitigate a Mature Quest to Quickening. However, it often brings more harm than good as its consequences taint everything related to the Quest with Ambience. 
* A roundabout way is to connect a Quest to active Factors in your scenario through Investigate or Research. Suddenly you have a more tangible target to deal with, and if you succeed in doing so you might mitigate a Quest, and maybe even Heal it!


In a box!
Investigate
When you follow your leads to seedy taverns, dusty libraries and the halls of power to solve a mystery, roll +Lore spent, up to +3. On a hit, Connect an existing Factor to the mystery; they are not responsible for it, but they surely know more. On a 10+, Reveal a Factor in the map as the key to the mystery.
On a miss, your investigation push forces behind the mystery or interested in it to make a move against you. 


However, not everyone agrees with you and many would think your remedy is their poison. Whenever you mitigate a Quest there will be a Backlash from a House or connected Factor. They will move in to frustrate your efforts or turn them against you for their own gain. This Backlash can be an Influence struggle or a Hard GM Move towards the elements of your Quest. Persist and be wise, a Backlash is a sign you are on the right track. 
New Dawn Rises
To change the world for the better has the power to change one’s life. 


When a Quest is Healed:
* The responsible Guild gains an extra Decree. 
* The Hero(es) who Zoomed in the Quest write a Covenant with those whose life you helped change. 


When a Quest is Lost: 
* Every Guild in the Venture loses Influence over every House. 
* Or a new House centered around the Quest might be born, starting with Influence over every Guild in the Venture.
* Or a new Factor is added to the setting… a very hostile and poignant Factor.
